# Internet Sales Analysis
## Overview

Effective sales management requires a unified view of transaction data, customer demographics, and product hierarchies. This project demonstrates a full-cycle business intelligence workflow by extracting and cleansing data from a relational database using MS SQL Server to build a high-performance Power BI dashboard. The technical solution involves advanced SQL transformations to standardize date formats and customer attributes, followed by the architecture of a Star Schema to enable deep-dive analysis into sales trends and regional performance. The final report provides stakeholders with a consolidated view of "Internet Sales," allowing for data-driven decisions on inventory optimization and targeted marketing strategies.
